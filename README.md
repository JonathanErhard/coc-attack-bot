# COC Attack Bot

This fork was created to work with the night-village. It automatically collects the lootcart and changes the state mashine slightly. I do not recommend looking at the code its all horrible and everyone involved in the project should be ashamed of themselves for writing it. Following this sentence is the original README, although I cannot ensure that it is up to date with my fork since I cba to read and correct it.
A Windows automation bot for Clash of Clans that can record attack sessions and replay them automatically with AI-powered base analysis.

## Quick Start Guide

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always run Clash of Clans in FULL SCREEN mode during all operations!**

### 1. Initial Setup

1. **Open Clash of Clans in FULL SCREEN mode** (this is crucial for accurate coordinates)
2. Run the bot: `python main.py`
3. Go to "Game Detection" to verify the bot can find your game window
4. Take a screenshot to confirm the capture area is correct

### 2. Map Key Coordinates

**This is the most important step - you need to map button positions for your specific screen resolution.**

1. Select "Coordinate Mapping" from the main menu
2. Choose "Start coordinate mapping"
3. Move your mouse to important game elements and press **F2** to record each position:
   - **Attack button** (to start searching for bases)
   - **Next button** (to skip bases during search)
   - **Return home button** (after attack completion)
4. Enter descriptive names for each coordinate (e.g., "attack_button", "barbarian", "archer")
5. Press **F3** to save all coordinates when finished

**Essential coordinates to map:**
- `attack_button` - The attack button to start base search
- `next_button` - Skip to next base during search
- `find_a_match` - find a match button
- `return_home` - Return home after attack

### 3. Record Attack Strategies

1. Select "Attack Recording" from the main menu
2. Choose "Start new recording"
3. Enter a descriptive name for your attack strategy (e.g., "barch_collector_raid")
4. **Manual Mode (Recommended):** Press **F6** to record each click precisely
5. Use **F7** to add delays between actions when needed
6. Record a complete attack sequence from troop deployment to completion
7. Press **F5** when finished to stop and save the recording

**Recording Tips:**
- Record different strategies for different base types
- Include delays between troop deployments for better timing
- Record the full sequence including returning home

### 4. Set Up Auto Attacker (AI-Powered)

1. Ensure you have configured your Gemini API key in `src\utils\config.py`
2. Select "Auto Attacker" from the main menu
3. Choose "Start auto attack"
4. Set your minimum loot requirements:
   - Minimum gold (default: 300,000)
   - Minimum elixir (default: 300,000)
   - Minimum dark elixir (default: 2,000)
5. Select the attack strategy you want to use
6. The bot will automatically:
   - Search for bases
   - Analyze loot using AI
   - Attack suitable bases
   - Return home and repeat

### 5. Manual Attack Playback

1. Select "Attack Playback" from the main menu
2. Choose "Play attack"
3. Select your recorded session
4. Make sure COC is in the attack screen with a base loaded
5. Press Enter to begin playback

**Playback Tips:**
- Ensure game state matches when the recording was made
- Use slower playback speeds for more reliable execution
- Always supervise the playback process

## Configuration

The bot uses `src\utils\config.py` for all configuration settings. After copying from `example.config.py`, you can modify:

### Essential Settings

**AI Analysis Settings:**
- `google_gemini_api_key` - Your Gemini API key (required for AI features)
- `enabled` - Set to `True` to enable AI base analysis
- `min_gold`, `min_elixir`, `min_dark_elixir` - Minimum loot requirements for auto attacks

**Other Settings:**
- Hotkey bindings for all operations
- Default directories for screenshots, recordings, coordinates
- Automation timing and speed settings
- Game detection parameters

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Full Screen Mode** - **ALWAYS** run Clash of Clans in full screen mode for accurate coordinate mapping
2. **Screen Resolution** - Keep your screen resolution consistent between recording and playback
3. **Game State** - Make sure COC is in the same state when playing back attacks
4. **Coordinate Mapping** - Take time to accurately map all essential buttons and positions
5. **Practice Mode** - Test your recordings on practice attacks first
6. **Playback Speed** - Use slower speeds (0.5x) for more reliable playback
7. **AI Analysis** - Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota
8. **Supervision** - Always supervise the bot during operation
9. **Army Ready** - Make sure your army is trained before starting auto attacks
10. **Internet Connection** - Stable internet required for AI analysis features

## Safety Features

- **Failsafe** - Move mouse to top-left corner to stop all automation
- **Emergency Stop** - Press ESC during any operation to stop immediately
- **Validation** - Recordings are validated before playback
- **Logging** - All actions are logged for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Game Not Detected
- Make sure COC is running and visible
- Try different window modes (full screen vs windowed)
- Check if you're using a supported emulator

### Playback Issues
- Verify coordinates are mapped correctly for your resolution
- Check that the game is in the correct state before playback
- Try slower playback speeds
- Validate recordings before playing them

### Recording Problems
- Make sure the recording hotkeys aren't conflicting with other software
- Check that the bot has proper permissions to detect input
- Verify the screenshots directory is writable
